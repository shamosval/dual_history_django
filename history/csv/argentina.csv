This seemingly peculiar practice was employed by Rosas as a political strategy to maintain his hold on power and control over the provinces of the Argentine Confederation. Urquiza's pronouncement accepted Rosas's resignation on behalf of the Province of Entre Ríos, allowing it to resume its trade and foreign relations until the establishment of a formal republic. Urquiza's pronouncement gained support from the governor of Corrientes, Benjamin Virasoro, but Rosas refused to accept it and remained in office.
